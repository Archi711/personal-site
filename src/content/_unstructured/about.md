# Hi, my name is Arek. I'm a fullstack dev and designer

_i.e. I write a lot of TSX/Astro files and take care about how it looks._

Hard to express my gratitude to see you here.
My primary skills circle around TS and React. I'm fairly sure I can comprehend
a lot - so that's why I'm also trying to make web look _good_.

I'm known for making things work. Ugly landing is better that beautiful catastrophe.
Uncle Bob would be mad, but in JS world, all sorts of heresy are accepted!

_Anyway..._

Currently trying my best to not get mad (I look at you MS with your stupid Copilot).
